# TomScottSevenSegment
https://youtu.be/ZVcOmdNIsSs my video of making this.

Tom Scott wanted to see what the longest word you could make using seven segment displays was. So, TomScottLongestWordOG.js is pretty much a copy of the code he used to do so. It reads off words.txt, creates an array of every word in word.txt, and passes it through a for loop containing some checks, finding the longest word. 
At the end of his video, he basically said "However, this code doesn't check for multiple words fitting the criteria of the same length. I'll leave that to you." I took him up on that.
